# Status : (Git instruction under construction, GITでマニュアルの作成中)
## 2021/01/31 The Readme and set up instruction are currently a bit of a mess, but will get it sorted and updated by the end of the month 
## 2021 GOAL:  Create sensors interface with all option able to be changed in the interace. 

Successor to [SDS-011-Python](https://github.com/JarvisSan22/SDS-011-Python)
Happy to recive feedback, and implement contributions  

Raspberry pi (RPI) or linux system base for a sensor network, of SDS011 and DHT22. 
Network made up of ESP8266 Sensor nodes sending data to the network base over a local ip. 
Using the previous code in [SDS-011-Python](https://github.com/JarvisSan22/SDS-011-Python), GPS maps walk and logger data can be run on a RPI 
Network data is displated using plotly dash for a nice clean interface.
